- sealed classes are used to restirct the inheritance hierarchy while also allowing extension points ( sealed, final , non-sealed)
use abstract to define the method contract and let the subclasses implement their own business logic
use enum or returning string for fixed set of values

- switch expression : can return values, allows null (must handle null case explicitly), allows unnamed variables and pattern matching
- unnamed variables : if you don't use it then don't name it.
